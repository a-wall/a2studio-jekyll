<p>The original property was a two-storey three-bedroom Victorian mid-terrace house which contained a maze of small rooms on the ground floor.</p>

<p>The client brief was to create more usable open space adopting the house to modern family living.</p>

<p>The solution was to build a side return extension to the rear and to remove the internal walls on the ground floor to create a spacious kitchen-diner space where the family could congregate.  The extension also features a large rooflight and sliding folding glass doors which can open up the entire space to the garden patio in nice weather.  This provides a light filled open-plan eating and living area.</p>

<p>The open plan space features a modern kitchen along one side with a stainless steel countertop and Moroccan tiles.</p>

<p>The internal floor finish on the ground floor has been replaced with reclaimed oak floor boards which is visually continued to the garden with level timber decking bringing the outside in and extending the room.</p>

<p>The first floor layout was kept intact with the exception of the new enlarged bathroom which combines the previously separated toilet and bathroom.  The attic space above the master bedroom was removed to expose the pitched roof above.</p>

<p>First floor bedroom and bathroom windows were changed to match the folding sliding doors on the ground floor transforming the rear elevation to a modern facade.  The extension utilizes a modern vocabulary yet blends in with the existing palette of materials of the neighbouring buildings.</p>
