<p>The original property is a five-storey Victorian mid-terraced house in Crouch End, North London which was in dire need for modernisation.</p>
<p>The client brief was to adapt the house to modern family living which involved the rethinking of the use of all rooms. As a result the entire house has been renovated and the layout reconfigured.</p>
<p>On the lower ground floor a large light-filled open plan kitchen-living area was created to become the new centre of the house. It features a frameless glass side extension and the rear facade has been opened up to the garden with full height bi-fold doors.</p>
<p>The clientâ€™s special focus was on using a rich mixture of textured and reclaimed materials.</p>
<p>The flooring in the kitchen-living space combines reclaimed oak parquet with large format distressed chapel limestone tiles. The kitchen features exposed limewashed brick walls, vintage oak kitchen doors and a concrete work surface.</p>
<p>A bespoke timber storage wall was introduced on the ground floor separating the entrance hall and reception room to provide a more formal entrance to the reception room and an integrated wardrobe.</p>
<p>On level 1 a former bedroom has been transformed into a spacious bathroom featuring a freestanding bathtub and special hand painted lavastone tiles.</p>
<p>To celebrate the amazing views of Alexandra Palace the loft has been converted with a dormer extension incorporating full-height sliding doors.</p>
